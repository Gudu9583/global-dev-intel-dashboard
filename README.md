## 👩‍💻 My Role: Data Analyst (3+ years)

As a Senior Data Analyst, I directed the entire analytics lifecycle, partnering with policy experts, data engineers, and executive stakeholders to deliver measurable impact:

- **Strategic Data Acquisition & Integration:**  
  - Sourced, extracted, and unified diverse datasets (World Bank, UN, local agencies, open data APIs).
  - Automated ETL pipelines for scheduled data refreshes and seamless integration.

- **Data Quality Engineering:**  
  - Led robust data cleaning (outlier detection, imputation, normalization, deduplication).
  - Established validation protocols and collaborated with data stewards to ensure data integrity and security.

- **Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Identified trends, root causes, and outliers through advanced statistical analysis and visual storytelling (pandas, seaborn, Power BI).
  - Partnered with subject matter experts to extract actionable insights and contextualize findings.

- **Feature Engineering & Composite KPI Development:**  
  - Designed and implemented domain-informed features (e.g., HDI proxies, infrastructure indices, time-series aggregations).
  - Conducted feature selection and dimensionality reduction to optimize dashboard performance.

- **Dashboard Design & Deployment:**  
  - Developed scalable, interactive dashboards (Dash, Plotly, Power BI) for real-time monitoring and scenario analysis.
  - Optimized for user experience, accessibility, and multi-stakeholder reporting.

- **Impactful Reporting & Storytelling:**  
  - Delivered clear, actionable reports tailored for technical and C-suite audiences.
  - Presented findings to international working groups and incorporated feedback to improve analytics products.

- **Continuous Improvement & Governance:**  
  - Established monitoring for KPI drift and data pipeline health.
  - Iteratively enhanced analytics solutions based on evolving stakeholder needs and best practices.
